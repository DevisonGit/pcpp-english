# they can help you tag those sections of code that are
# to be done in the future, or are left for further improvement, e.g.:
# TODO: Add a function that takes the val and prc arguments.


# they can help you comment (and uncomment) those
# sections of code that you want to test, e.g.:
def fun(val):
    return val * 2


user_value = int(input("Enter the value: "))
# fun(user_value)
# user_value = user_value + "foo"

print(fun(user_value))

# they can help you plan your work and outline
# certain sections of code that you will be designing, e.g.:

# Step 1: Ask the user for the value.
# Step 2: Change the value to an int and handle possible exceptions.
# Step 3: Print the value multiplied by 0.7.
